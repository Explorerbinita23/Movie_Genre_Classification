## Movie_Genre_Classification using NLP and Machine Learning
In this project, a machine learning model is built that can predict the genre of a movie based on its description summary. TF-IDF vectorization or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines are implemented.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify movies into genres based on their titles and descriptions. 
The key steps involved are:
### Data Preprocessing:  
Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling, including handling missing values and text preprocessing.
### Feature Engineering with TF-IDF Vectorization: 
Converting text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization to prepare for model training.
### Model Training and Evaluation: 
Building and evaluating machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, to find the best-performing classifier.
### Optimization by Dropping Highly Correlated Features: 
Enhancing model performance by identifying and removing highly correlated features that may introduce redundancy.
### Model Saving and Deployment: 
Saving the trained model and vectorizers for future use, and deploying the model as an API for real-time predictions.
